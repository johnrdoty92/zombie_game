# Learn Pygame

This is a simple project for anyone looking to get started with pygame. I put this together to teach myself how to use pygame and thought that it might end up being useful to somebody else. In this project, I cover the following:

- Classes and Inheritance
- Sprites
- Drawing with blit and moving characters
- User Events
- Collision detection
- Fonts and rendering text
